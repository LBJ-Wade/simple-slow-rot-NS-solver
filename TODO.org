* Use SpEC's InfoAtLink approach
* Check for fencepost errors
* Get rid of BG_MAX_SIZE restriction?
* Maybe use [[https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts][cxxopts]] for parsing command line?
** But then we won't be able to use config files
* Maybe use [[https://github.com/awsteiner/o2scl][o2scl]] wrapper around GSL?
* Create an abstract base class for EOS, which ppEOS extends.
* Better documentation
* Include a `test` rule in Makefile
** Move tests into separate dir
